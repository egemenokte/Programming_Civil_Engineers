Here’s a breakdown of these concepts:\n","\n","### Functions in Python\n","Functions are blocks of code that are designed to do one specific job. When you want to perform a particular task that you've defined in a function, you call the function responsible for it. Python functions are categorized into several types based on how they are defined and used:\n","\n","### Modules in Python\n","Modules in Python are files containing Python definitions and statements. A module can define functions, classes, and variables intended to be used in other Python programs.\n","\n","#### Importing Modules\n","You can import the entire module or parts of it to your current script. This is done using the `import` statement. For example, you can import the standard module `math` to access mathematical functions:\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"t6gH8b9h0LAu"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Let's have a quick introduction to modules.

The method iteratively improves an initial guess through a simple averaging process. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the method:\n","\n","#### Step-by-Step Algorithm\n","\n","1. **Initial Guess:**\n","   - Start with an initial guess for the square root. A common choice is half of the number whose square root is being calculated.\n","\n","2. **Iterative Improvement:**\n","   - Update the guess by averaging it with the number divided by the guess.\n","\n","3. **Stopping Criteria:**\n","   - Repeat the iteration until the desired accuracy is achieved. This can be controlled by a maximum number of iterations or a tolerance level that stops the process when the change in the guess becomes very small.\n","\n","#### Mathematical Formula\n","\n","Given a number $ x $ for which we want to find the square root, the Babylonian method iteratively applies the following formula:\n","\n","$ \\text{new_guess} = \\frac{(\\text{old_guess} + \\frac{x}{\\text{old_guess}})}{2} $\n","\n","#### Pseudo Algorithm\n","\n","1. Initialize `guess` to $ \\frac{x}{2} $\n","2. Loop for a fixed number of iterations or until the change in `guess` is below a specified tolerance:\n","   - Calculate `new_guess` as the average of `guess` and $ \\frac{x}{\\text{guess}} $.\n","   - If the absolute difference between `new_guess` and `guess` is less than the tolerance (say $10^{-3}$), break the loop.\n","   - Update `guess` to `new_guess`.\n","3. Return the final `guess` as the approximated square root.\n","\n","### Example Calculation\n","\n","Let's approximate the square root of 25 using the Babylonian method:\n","\n","1. **Initial Guess:** $\\text{guess} = \\frac{25}{2} = 12.5 $\n","2. **Iterations:**\n","   - 1st iteration: $ \\text{new_guess} = \\frac{(12.5 + \\frac{25}{12.5})}{2} = 7.25 $\n","   - 2nd iteration: $ \\text{new_guess} = \\frac{(7.25 + \\frac{25}{7.25})}{2} \\approx 5.349 $\n","   - 3rd iteration: $ \\text{new_guess} = \\frac{(5.349 + \\frac{25}{5.349})}{2} \\approx 5.011 $\n","   - 4th iteration: $ \\text{new_guess} = \\frac{(5.011 + \\frac{25}{5.011})}{2} \\approx 5.000 $\n","\n","3. **Result:** After a few iterations, the guess stabilizes around 5, which is the square root of 25.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"RJr417doM21b"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def babylonian_sqrt(number, iterations=100,tolerance=10**-3):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Approximates the square root of a number using the Babylonian method.\n","\n","    Parameters:\n","    - number: The number to find the square root of.
