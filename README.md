# Programming for (Civil) Engineers

Welcome to the GitHub repository for CEE 244: Programming for Engineers, a course offered by the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at UMass Amherst. This course introduces essential programming concepts and practical applications for engineers, using Python as the primary language. The course uses Google Colab as an accessible, cloud-based programming interface. While the examples and exercises are occasionally tailored to Civil Engineering contexts, the foundational programming concepts covered are broadly applicable and beneficial for all engineers.

Created for Fall 2024 Semester

## Applications


There are some applications in the applications folder. There could be more than the ones listed here. 

### 1. Double Pendulum Animation in Python
Simulates and animates a chaotic double pendulum system resembling a stick figure named "Freddy." This demonstration showcases the principles of chaotic motion through matplotlib animations.  
**Key Features**:
- Models physics with parameters like gravity, pendulum lengths, and initial angles.
- Animates stick figure components (head, arms, legs) using double pendulum equations.
